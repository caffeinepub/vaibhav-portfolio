# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the portfolio ready to publish by correcting the footer copyright text and adding clear deployment instructions for the Internet Computer.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the site footer to display the exact static text: "© 2026 Vaibhav Gaikwad" (no dynamic year), without breaking other footer content (e.g., social links).
- Add a repo-level deployment guide (e.g., `DEPLOYMENT.md`) documenting prerequisites and the commands/steps to build and deploy the existing frontend + single Motoko canister to the Internet Computer.

**User-visible outcome:** The live site footer shows the required copyright line exactly as specified, and developers can follow a new repository guide to build and deploy the app.
