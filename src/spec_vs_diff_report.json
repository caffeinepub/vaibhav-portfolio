A deployment guide was added, but it is located under frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md and the provided diff content is truncated mid-section, so repo-level placement and completeness vs REQ-16 cannot be fully confirmed from the diff summary.",

      "requirement": "Add a repo-level publishing/deployment guide (e.g., DEPLOYMENT.md) documenting steps to build and deploy to the Internet Computer.",
      "reason": "A deployment guide was added, but it is under frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md rather than at the repository root, and the shown content ends abruptly after “Your application will be accessible at:”, so it’s unclear from the diff whether the guide is complete and repo-level as requested.",
